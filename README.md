Clausewitz-EU4-Editor
=====================

This is a mod editor for the grand strategy game Europa Universalis 4 made by Paradox Interactive. This editor will first focus on country editing but later on editing for ideas, cultures and religions will be added.
The editor is written in C# and available under the GPL v2 license. You need the .net framework 4.5 in order to run it.

Currently the editor is in public preview mode. this means that the editor can read the game data and display it in the controls, you can change things and the subeditor for national ideas and ideas group can be used. However you cannot save anything yet and only country editing is available.

Planning
--------

Currently available:
* country reading with all of its variables except for historical names
* seeing all the possibilites of governments\religions\cultures\techgroups

In planning: (aka comming soon(c))
* saving (offcourse, high priority
* choose wich gamefiles you want to load from basegame and wich from a mod
* flag info control
* creating new country wizard (i will try to include localization and flags for this)
* adding editors for governments, cultures, religions and techgroups (and maybe units)
